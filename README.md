## Fuck, I forgot to turn on WIFI.

This is a app that is using WIFI and GEO position to make a map of where you have connected to WIFI.

### User case:
You just came home where you have a WIFI, but you turned WIFI off on your phone earlier on the day for some reason.

You are sitting on you toilet and are watching YouTube videos, after 30 min when you are done you realize that you forgot to turn on WIFI and you data for the rest of the month is gone. And itâ€™s only the 3rd.

By using this app you get a reminder that you are not using your WIFI at home, even if the WIFI is off. (only if you have been using WIFI there before)
